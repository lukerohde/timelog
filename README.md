Qtruby cross platform desktop app for retrospectively logging time, creating tasks and taking notes. 
It pops up and reminds you to note what you've been doing rather than expecting you to start a timer when you start a task.
And rather than expecting you to create tasks first, it creates tasks based upon the names of time items.
It strives to hassle you to log your time but then get out of the way fast. 

A classic scenario: You are working on project A, person from project B rings, interrupting you and talks for 45 mins.  
It pops up reminding you to jot down where you were up to with project A, and start taking phone notes.
When the call finishes, you know how much time the call took, and its billed to the appropriate project with notes.
You review the notes you jotted down from project A, dismiss the logger and get back to work.  Its seemless.
